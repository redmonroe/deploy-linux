# deploy-linux: add second route to flask

This is a simple minimal Flask app. Flask is an application that allows a programmer to quickly create the basic structure of a website and can comprehend a range of extensions that adds functionality as your website grows.

This particular implementation is deliberately simple and can be used to practice deployments in local environments and to remote servers.

## Setup Second Routes

```
$ mkdir dlinux && cd dlinux
$ git clone https://github.com/redmonroe/deploy-linux.git
```
