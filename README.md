# deploy-linux: add second route to flask

This is a simple minimal Flask app. Flask is an application that allows a programmer to quickly create the basic structure of a website and can comprehend a range of extensions that adds functionality as your website grows.

This particular implementation is deliberately simple and can be used to practice deployments in local environments and to remote servers.

## Setup Second Routes

This branch is implemented with a second flask route to demonstrate that remote serve is serving routes properly. See routes.py for changes.
